# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT

## API Keys Were Publicly Exposed!

**Date:** June 28, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Risk:** Financial and Security Impact

### What Happened
Your `.env` file containing API keys was committed to a public GitHub repository, making the following keys publicly accessible:

- **OpenAI API Key:** `sk-svcacct-8rThi0g...`
- **Google API Key:** `AIzaSyDwmCOZ...` 
- **Voyage API Key:** `pa-uXwx6FaEE...`

### Immediate Actions Required

#### 1. REVOKE ALL EXPOSED KEYS (Do this NOW!)
- **OpenAI:** https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- **Google Cloud:** https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
- **Voyage AI:** https://www.voyageai.com/

#### 2. Check for Unauthorized Usage
- Review usage logs for unexpected API calls
- Monitor billing for unauthorized charges
- Set up usage alerts if available

#### 3. Generate New Keys
- Create new API keys for all services
- Update your local `.env` file with new keys
- Test your applications with new keys

### Prevention Measures Implemented
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future `.env` commits
- Created `.env.example` template for safe sharing
- Added security warnings in code comments

### Best Practices Going Forward
1. **NEVER** commit `.env` files to version control
2. Use `.env.example` for sharing configuration templates
3. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` before first commit
4. Use environment variables in production
5. Regular security audits of your repositories

### Need Help?
If you're unsure about any of these steps, please:
1. Revoke the keys immediately (safety first)
2. Seek help from a security professional
3. Review GitHub's security best practices

**Remember:** It only takes one exposed key to compromise your entire project!
