• An item master is a record of all the key information 
about a particular item of inventory.
• Contains attributes like item description, specifications, 
size, weight, and manufacturing information
• Cost Data
•
Standard Cost ( Direct & Indirect cost)
• Inventory Information 
•
Current Stock Levels, minimum order quantities & lead times
• Supplier Information
•
Details about supplier

• A Bill of Materials (BOM) is a structured list that details 
all the raw materials, sub-assemblies, components, and 
parts needed to manufacture a product. 
• Comprehensive Inventory
•
It lists every item required, from raw materials to finished sub-
assemblies. 
• Quantity Specifications:
•
It specifies the exact quantities of each component needed. 
• Hierarchical Structure:
•
BOMs can be single-level, showing only the direct 
components, or multi-level, outlining the relationships 
between sub-assemblies and their components.

Work Center

•
A work center is a physical or logical location where work is 
performed, often within a manufacturing or production 
environment.
•
Physical or Logical:
•
Work centers can be a defined physical area (like a specific 
workshop) or a logical grouping of resources (like a team of 
employees performing a specific task). 
•
Resource Management:
•
They allow for the allocation of resources (machines, labor, 
materials) to specific tasks or operations.
•
Scheduling and Routing:
•
Work centers are used to schedule and route operations, ensuring 
that tasks are performed in the correct sequence and at the 
appropriate location.

• Routing refers to the sequential order of operations 
needed to transform raw materials into finished products
• Defining the Production Flow:
•
Routing maps out the step-by-step process of manufacturing, 
from initial raw materials to the final product, ensuring that 
each task is performed in the correct order. 
• Resource Allocation:
•
Routing also helps determine which work centers, machines, 
and labor resources are needed for each operation, facilitating 
effective resource planning and allocation.

•
Manufacturing Lead Time
•
Manufacturing lead time is the total time it takes for a product to 
move through the entire production process, from initial order 
placement to final shipment.
•
It includes order preparation, Sourcing & Procurement, Production, 
Quality control, Packaging & shipping.
•
Purchase Lead Time
•
Purchase Lead time refers to the time it takes for a company to 
receive an order after it has been placed with a supplier.
•
Safety Stock / Capacity
•
Safety stock, also known as buffer stock, is extra inventory held to 
mitigate the risk of stockouts due to unforeseen circumstances, 
such as demand fluctuations or supply chain disruptions
